# 🧾 Jira Test Management & Bug Reporting Process

This document explains how test cases are written, managed, and how bugs are reported using **Jira** during the QA process for the Sweet Shop project.

## 📌 Test Case Documentation in Jira

- Test case IDs match the naming convention used in the `TestCases.md` file.
- Each test includes:
  - Preconditions
  - Steps
  - Expected Results
